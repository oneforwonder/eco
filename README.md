# eco

Eco will eventually be an ecology simulator created with Quil and Clojure.

Currently it does not simulate anything, but we're working real hard on that.

Our current model takes into account plants, herbivores, carnivores, and decomposers as they cycle various nutrients through the environment.

## Usage

Leiningen - from project root at command line, `lein run` to get sketch going.

LightTable - open `core.clj` and press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` to evaluate the file.

Emacs - run cider, open `core.clj` and press `C-c C-k` to evaluate the file.

REPL - run `(require 'eco.core)`.
